        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mochiko chicken is chicken that has been marinated in a mochiko flour batter, then deep fried. The resulting morsels of savory-sweet, crunchy yet toothsome chicken are a popular treat in Hawai'i.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
            <li>3/4 c mochiko flour</li>
            <li>3/4 c cornstarch</li>
            <li>3/4 c sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 c shoyu</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 t ginger, grated</li> 
            <li>3/4 c green onions, sliced thin</li>
            <li>1 1/2 t salt</li>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the chicken into uniform, bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the remaining ingredients (the marinate should be thick, about the consistency of peanut butter).</li>
            <li>Coat the chicken evenly with the marinade, and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (preferably overnight).</li>
            <li>Take the chicken out of the refrigerator about 20 minutes before frying.</li>
            <li>Fry the chicken in enough oil so that it does not touch the pan when frying. Fry until deep golden brown.</li>
        </ol>
